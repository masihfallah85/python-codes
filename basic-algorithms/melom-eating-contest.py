#melom-eating-contest

"""
In this script, we simulate a melon-eating contest with n melons (1 to 100).
Each melon has an index and a mass (integer).
Each time, the two melons with the smallest indices are compared, and the one with lesser mass is eaten.
This continues until only one melon remains.
The goal is to output the index of the final remaining melon â€” the one with the greatest mass.
Constraints: No functions or data structures are used.
