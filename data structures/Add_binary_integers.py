#Add_binary_integers

"""
In this script we want to add two n-bit integers and return an n+1 bit integer stored in array wich A[1] is most significant bit and
A[n] is least significant bit.first we have an empty list named C.starting form n and going to 1,we initialize a carry = 0 and find
(A[n] + B[n] + carry) (mod 2) storing it in c[n + 1],then we change carry depending on mod_2 of (A[i] + B[i] + carry) and going to next i
in descending order,when the loop finishes we put the last carry in C[1],terminating the function succesfuly.in floyde_hoare logic
{carry and A[i] and B[i]}C[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i] + carry{carry = 1 if A[i] + B[i] + carry >= 2 else 0}/{i = n}C[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i] + carry{C[1] = carry}

Worst,best,average case are similar.T(n) = c1 * (n + 1) + c2 * 1 + c3 * (n + 1) + c4 * (n) + c5 * (n)  + c6 = an + b,a linear function

of n,wich makes overall complexity Î˜(n).
